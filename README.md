# SQL Injection Vulnerability Laboratory

### Hello there!

>This is a Lab to demonstrate how SQL Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited into login enviroments that do not archieve the security practices like SQL Queries Parametrization, symbols validation, etc.

Into this repository it will be storage all the files and methodology to replicate this enviroment by your own using Python and Tkinter.

The following part describes all the steps that can be follow in order to understand the construction of the lab and the workflow that an SQLI follow.

>1. File 1: SQL query using Python.

>2. File 2: Simple Forms using Tkinter (TextField, Label, Button, Alerts, Images)

>3. File 3: Print a SQL query value into a Tkinter Form.

>4. File 4: Tkinter Login Form.

>5. File 5: SQL Injection suceptible login.

## If you want to run this lab examples using Ubuntu as I did to code this, follow this instructions:
1. Make sure you have python installed.
   >`python3 --version`
2. Execute the file dependencies_ubuntu.sh
   >`chmod +x dependencies_ubuntu.sh`
   
   >`./dependencies_ubuntu.sh`
3. Execute the file imp_db.sh
   >`chmod +x imp_db.sh`
   
   >`./imp_db.sh`
4. Well Done :)

Have a good time exploring this basic project built to explain SQL injections and hardcoded password vulnerabilities.
